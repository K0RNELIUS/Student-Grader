# Student-Grader
Welcome to the Student-Grader wiki!\
The stack used to develop the student-grader was python.\
Having in mind the desire to use dictionaries data structures to solidate my knowledges with this datatype, this program applies a simple grading system to allow teachers to register classes, add students grades, and view information.\
Also, it let's students view all their grades for the classes they belong.\
Some possible improvements can be:\
1 - Implement a not only local database to store class informations\
2 - Develop a GUI to improve UI/UX\
3 - Allow the teacher to further configurate their grading system, not only by number but weight
